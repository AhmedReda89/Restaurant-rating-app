# Restaurant Reviews App

This app, includes some offline caching features, with some accessibilty and Interface responsiveness to fit most devices.

## Getting Started

* First clone or download the project from GitHub to your local computer.
* Then in the project folder, start up a simple HTTP server to serve up the site files on your local computer. Python has some simple tools to do this, and you don't even need to know Python. 
* In a terminal, check the version of Python you have: python -V. If you have Python 2.x, spin up the server with python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000 (or some other port, if port 8000 is already in use.) For Python 3.x, you can use python3 -m http.server 8000. If you don't have Python installed, navigate to Python's website to download and install the software.
* Or you can even install a Google chrome extension to do the same thing like this [one](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/web-server-for-chrome/ofhbbkphhbklhfoeikjpcbhemlocgigb?hl=en)
* Then pick the folder where you downloaded your project and add the port (in this example its 8000, but you can change it)
